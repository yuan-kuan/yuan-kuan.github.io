- quicker turn around from deploy to first test.
- on-call style, even quicker turn around for fix iteration.
- Test case preparation for both QA later and dev as yardstick when developing Card.
- Existing module smoke test and test cases generation. Building up a test case library for critical feature.

## Min RM 1k for QA each month

SpeedHome agree to commit a minimal of RM 1k each month just for manual QA work. This mean, if there are not enough testing task to go around (not enough card, delayed development, etc), we will need to perform QA work on stuff not started by SH, to fill up the missing hours. Example, smoke test on existing critical feature and generate test cases from the test. The minimal pay here is mainly to protect ES QA from totally cut off for certain months, like April and May. This is just a min, if we have enough tasks to burst this limit, that is a good news.

## New expectation

SpeedHome hopes to achieve two things:

1. More frequent small releases.
2. ES fully QA release before passing up for sign off.

New feature/bug fix will come in smaller size now, with a shorter cycle - 2 weeks. To achieve this, QA work will need to perform quicker in a short notice. During the period of first beta until release, a more attended schedule to keep the feedback loop running smooth between developer and QA, the bug-report-fix-repeat cycle.

I am intented to zone out SH product owner involved during the development. They will be involved when we are working out the first requirement, expected outcomes and testing parameters. Then the ball will be solely on our court, we will develop the feature as stated, beta test it and verify it againts the agreed outcome. Our QA, you, will be the one decide if the feature is good to be release. By then, SH product owner will be notified about the QA verified build, and do their sign off.

These are not easy thing to achieve on our side, especially given our track record of not able to do this, SpeedHome POs always ahead of our QA verification. So we will need to change this, and this hinge on your ability to do that.

I have some ideas, but I also need you to think about this and tell me how could we make this work.

## Idea 1: Fixed shift

RM 1k actually translate into 40 hours of manual QA work. One way to make this work is we decide a fixed working hours and day you will do QA for ES work. e.g 4 hours on Wednesday afternnon and 4 hours on Thursday morning. Developers will need to be aware of the QA shift, and make sure the beta can be ready before your working hours. 

If there are no beta build for you to test during the shift, you still carry on QA work with ES, since you are committed the shift for us. This is when you can work on existing critical feature, smoke test them and create test cases from the test, contribute into our test case library. 

This will work if you prefer to block off your time, and knowing they will be paid no matter what. The shift can be adjust weekly or bi-weekly, it doesn't have to be rigid. As long as we can get the coverage necessary before release.

## Idea 2: Follow the development cycle

This is more flexible, more akin to how we are working currently. Since each Card is meant to be finish in 2 weeks cycle, as a team we know roughly which day the beta can be ready. Developer and QA agree on a date in the future, and commit to that. Developer need to prepare a beta before the date, and QA need to perform at least a full test within 24 hours of the agreed date. Then Developer and QA will further block off small hours in the upcoming days for the feedback cycle.

In other word, this one is a promised of work delivery after a date. Full test in 24 hours, then retest in 24 hours for everyone subsequence fixes.

---

These are just idea to have a fix commitment throughout a month. If there are more tasks to be done, and you have the time, then you can just do them as you see fit (like the current arrangement). Be it shift or following the development cycle, if we found out there are not enough tasks to go around for you to fulfil the RM 1k min hours, we will always create our own task to let you work on them.

These are just my thought now. Please tell me what you think. Do you still like these terms of working here?
