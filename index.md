# You're a frontend developer? Come work with Else Studio.

## Why?

**Freedom.**

You will start with a **project-based or a task-based payment**. As soon as the work is done and goal is met, we conclude the project, and you get the pay, then we proceed to the next project. There will be a delivery date which we both agreed before the starting of the project, which is usually just a rough estimate. Just keep me posted with progress every work day, even it is a small step. Maybe we will do a one-hour face to face meeting for the project conclusion. Maybe we will do a one-hour pair programming every other week. Maybe.

And that is it.

I do not know when you start working, how long is your break, or if you bring the kids to the beach on Monday morning. You could be hard at work, covered in noise-cancelling earphone in the middle of a noisy café, on a Sunday afternoon. Or shopping in an empty mall after an 11 a.m. brunch on a Tuesday. A night owl, peak at 3 a.m.? You do you. [This is how I work.](https://world.hey.com/kuan/my-typical-working-day-110e376b)

However, **do not mistreat** this is as a part-time programming job or side hustle from a full time employment. If you need only more money, there are better paid programming job out there. The flexibility is supposed to let you, and others, to work in your own term. Work revolve around your life, not the other way round. Failing to see value from this means Else Studio is a bad fit for you. 

## How much?

Ultimately, most of the pay are calculated by hourly basis. For the current opening, we will **start at RM 50/hour**. As mentioned, the first few pay out will be project based. I will estimate the hours required for the task to price each project. The completion of these projects will let us learn about our chemistry, short-comings, progress speed and the adjusted hourly rate for you. 

## What is the work? 

We are a software house specialized in **frontend development**. **Flutter** is the primary tool of choice, to build mobile applications, web applications, and potentially desktop applications. Secondary tools is **Svelte** for web only project. The aim is to deliver a slick, neat and robust GUI, efficiently. 

As a starter, you will be mostly work on **building Flutter Widgets, composing widgets to form a page, writing Widget tests and passing them.** Main challenges will be task like ensuring consistent styling, handle loading or missing data, disabling button, form validation, transition animation, accessibility, etc. 

We will practice most of Effective Dart. Strictly follow the discipline of logic vs presentation. Stateless first, stateful later. Asynchronous is our way of life. Always keep our Widget and integration tests populous and up to date. Test, test and test.

UX and UI designs are adequately provided by our clients, but we need to be sensitive to the result of our implementation. To the best of our ability, and within the boundary given by the original design, we will deliver a GUI that make sense and looks good. There will be a gap between the expectation of the intended design and the reality of UI programming and Flutter. It is our job to provide suggestion and advice back to the client for adaptation.

My current clients are either a very good backend developer, or already has a stable running backend. You will not write backend code here, at the moment. Future is unpredictable, and there's nothing stopping you to do anything at your own time.

## Who is in it together?

If you end up joining, the team size will be double. 

2-3 frontend engineers should make a beefy team for a good size application. My plan is to get a dedicated QA to do test planning and manual testing during development. As soon as we manage to sign a bigger project that includes UX&UI scope, I will invite a dedicated UX UI designer to the team.

Except the very rare occasion that you might interact with the client's backend programmer or designer (Which should be my job to communicate with the client), you will be working with less than 5 people, for a long while.
 
## When can you start?

**March or middle of March**. That's when the new projects are starting, and I should have prepared a good starting environment for the new partner by then.

## How to apply?

Prepare an **email**. In it:

1. Tell me who you are.
2. How is your working style and how would you adapt to the style I mentioned above.
3. Do you like any of these? Why and why not?   
4. A link to your GitHub or GitLab or any public (or private) repositories that contain your frontend projects and/or contributions.

**Number 4 is crucial**. **Git and the ability to build an app** is our requirements to work here. If you need time to push or create a project, you can ping me with an email first and send me the links when you're done. Exposing your projects is a good thing to do, even you end up not wanting this job.

Send it to [kuan@hey.com](mailto:kuan@hey.com). I will get back to you very quickly. Please expect a couple of email exchanges before we start the first project.

# About Else Studio

I have been working as a solo freelancer and solo tech founder for four years plus. Thanks to my sole client, itbh, I managed to enjoy a flexible lifestyle and a respectable earning to keep wife and I afloat in the lovely Sabah, my homeland. I don't mind continuing this way, but I have this little nudge in me that, asking me to work in a team.  

Recently (or early 2023 if this post got old), an opportunity knocks on my door. It is a mobile app rewrite project that require multiple me, working full time. At the same time, I still have an ongoing project, which I am committed to see it through. Workload overflows, and funding overflows. Time to grow!

I am now expanding my team of one, and forming a software house by the name Else Studio.

Else studio develops mobile/web/desktop applications. Currently, we specialized in frontend development, using Flutter as the main tools. All these while, I worked with external backend developer to achieve the common goal, deliver the full application. Else Studio will continue this specialization.

There are no backend capabilities yet. This shall be fixed as we grow, and achieve full stack eventually. If you are here looking for full-stack, try us. Maybe it is time already. 

# Who am I?

I, as the lead developer of Else Studio, have nothing much to show as a track record. The two ongoing projects are, well, ongoing. I cannot disclose nor display them here, yet. Here's what I did in terms of web and mobile application, from the most recent:

1. itbh Console (private) : A Dart programming language framework that generate Flutter project with routing, Stream-powered services and components.
2. [B4 the date](https://b4the.date) : Svelte + PouchDB/CoucbDB + Cloudflare workers and pages. 
3. [TaraKita](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/tarakita-app) : Svelte + PouchDB + Cloudflare. 
4. [fp-svelte](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/fp-tailwindcss-svelte-template) : Svelte starter template with a functional programming twist. Used by the two projects above. 
5. ANA (private) : Offline first web application to support heavy industry asset management in the field. AngularDart + PouchDB/CouchDB.
6. [dorker](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/dorker) : Web worker for AngularDart.

Before I built these web applications as a solo freelancer, I was a game developer. Worked in Unity and Ubisoft Singapore.
