# You're a web/app/frontend/backend/any developer? Come work with Else Studio.

## Why?

**Freedom.**

You will start with a **project-based or task-based payment**. As soon as the work is done and the goal is met, we conclude the project, and you get the pay by the month's end, accumulated, and then we proceed to the next project. Just keep me posted with progress every work day, even if it is a small step. Maybe we will do a one-hour face-to-face meeting for the project conclusion. Maybe we will do a one-hour pair programming every other week. Maybe.

And that is it.

I do not know when you start working, how long is your break, or if you bring the kids to the beach on Monday morning. You could be hard at work, covered in noise-cancelling earphones in the middle of a noisy caf√©, on a Sunday afternoon. Or shopping in an empty mall after an 11 a.m. brunch on a Tuesday. A night owl, peak at 3 a.m.? You do you. [This is how I work.](https://world.hey.com/kuan/my-typical-working-day-110e376b)

Deliver, on time and on point. We will build a reputable dev team together.

## How much?

Ultimately, most of the pay is calculated on an hourly basis. For the current opening, you can expect a roughy **RM 50/hour** payout, depending on your speed and accuracy. As mentioned, the first few payouts will be project-based. I will estimate the hours required for the task to price each project. The heuristic I used in my estimation was how many hours I assumed myself to complete the same project/task, and then I multiplied by my hourly rate. So, in essence, you will be paid for the hours you took off from me.

Completing these projects will let us learn about our chemistry, shortcomings, progress speed and the adjusted hourly rate for you.

## What is the work?

We are a software house specialising in **frontend development**, slowly moving into **full-stack**. **Flutter** is the primary tool of choice, to build mobile applications, web applications, and potentially desktop applications. We have not fully worked on a **full-stack** project yet, but we are slowly taking up **Java** backend job. **ReactJS** is used in maintaining a few clients' ongoing web applications. 

Here are a few recently completed tasks, that fall under the scope of this job:

- Understand the client's requirements posted in our Basecamp project. Ask questions to flush out the details. Implement the feature step by step. From scratch to complete.
- Follow the flow of the app states, listen to the changes and send out Firebase analytics events based on different conditions.
- Without relying on third-party packages, create a custom Widget. e.g. phone number input with country flag, Unique collage of photos, animated carousel indicator, OTP fields, etc.
- Follow the instructions of the client's designer, perform fine-grain GUI polish and perform Flutter magic to match the Figma mock-up. Don't worry, not pixel-perfect.
- Refactor the codes to become more readable, and create sharable Widgets/Functions after a handful of duplications of codes.
- Look at the bug report, navigate the codes and fix the bug.

We will practice most of Effective Dart. Strictly follow the discipline of logic vs presentation. Stateless first, stateful later. Asynchronous is our way of life. Always keep our Widget and integration tests populous and up to date. Test, test and test.

UX and UI designs are adequately provided by our clients, but we need to be sensitive to the result of our implementation. To the best of our ability, and within the boundary given by the original design, we will deliver a GUI that makes sense and looks good. There will be a gap between the expectation of the intended design and the reality of UI programming and Flutter. It is our job to provide suggestions and advice back to the client for adaptation.

My current clients are either very good backend developer or already has a stable running backend. You will not write backend code here, at the moment. The future is unpredictable, and nothing is stopping you from doing anything on your own time.

## Who is in it together?

If you end up joining, the team size will be 5.

A handful of software engineers with one or two QAs should make a beefy team for a good-sized application. As soon as we manage to sign a bigger project that includes UX&UI scope, I will invite a dedicated UX UI designer to the team.

Except for the rare occasion that you might interact with the client's backend programmer or designer, you will be working with less than 5 people, for a long while.

## When can you start?

**Anytime**.

## How to apply?

Prepare an **email**. In it:

1.  Tell me who you are.
2.  How is your working style and how would you adapt to the style I mentioned above?
3.  Do you like any of these? Why and why not?
4.  A link to your GitHub or GitLab or any public (or private) repositories that contain your front-end projects and/or contributions.

**Number 4 is crucial**. **Git and the ability to build an app** are our requirements to work here. If you need time to push or create a project, you can ping me with an email first and send me the links when you're done. Exposing your projects is a good thing to do, even if you end up not wanting this job.

Send it to [kuan@hey.com](mailto:kuan@hey.com). I will get back to you very quickly. Please expect a couple of email exchanges before we start the first project.

# About Else Studio

5th October 2023, Else Studio helped our first client, SpeedHome, to launch their third-time-rewrite of their mobile application SpeedHome: [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details/?id=com.speedrent&amp;hl=en), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/my/app/speedhome-my-property-rental/id998232868). This is Else Studio's first project and it is a big collective work done by the team for 6 months.

The work didn't stop there. For the next two months after launch, we dished out a ton of features, bug fixes and GUI polishes. Not only the users were served with a prettier, smoother and more solid stable mobile app. They are experiencing waves of quick bug fixes and GUI improvement at an unprecedented speed.

For November 2023 alone, we:

1. Ship a brand new frontend function for a ticketing system (creating tickets, attaching photos, videos and files, viewing tickets).
2. Built an event-based Firebase Analytics system, to avoid littering GUI and business logic with event tracking calls.
3. Refactor the legacy web application to support the localization of a new language.
4. Refactor the legacy web application to reliably display the product pricing structure.
5. Revive Deep Linking from previous old and outdated setups.
6. Polish the Chat Lobby and Chat room according to Figma.
7. +/- 20 miscellaneous bug fixes.

All these are without a single video call, without a fire from the live app which disturbs the team trance, without any over-time or rush, within or arriving earlier than the expected due dates.

**No video calls?** Yes. We managed November without a video call with the client or within the team. All communication is done in text, asynchronously. The client wrote down the requirements and followed up with answers and discussions mostly in a forum/long message type of thread. Feature shipped with proper Beta build available in PlayStore and TestFlight, the client tests the build and signs it off with their own devices. Create a bug card, have a discussion, and see the card resolved with another new build on their devices. No more "look at the app on my screen" video calls that last 2 hours with no product. No more hours of meeting with 5 people in it to discuss something that can be done in 3 text messages.

**No fire.** We shipped a robust and stable mobile app to the users. Since launch, we started to use our own in-house QA to provide better coverage before the build hit the production release. Things will still go wrong, we cannot be bulletproof. Rest assured, Else Studio owns the codes and we have a well-engineered foundation. There have not been any bugs that we cannot find the fix in hours and prepare a build in a day.

**No crunch.** We crunched once before the launch. But we have been cruising casually post-launch with the equivalent of contributions. I did not sign up for busy work with no life.

**On-time delivery.** We kept our promise so far and intend to keep it forever. A successful delivery is not only about a job well done. It is about managed expectations and well-formed requirements. This takes a lot of effort from both the client and the team. Having on-time deliveries thus far proved Else Studio has the ability and flexibility to work with the client in setting reasonable payload and deadlines.

# About Kuan, who started Else Studio

I have been working as a solo freelancer and solo tech founder for four years. Thanks to my sole client, itbh, I managed to enjoy a flexible lifestyle and a respectable earning to keep my wife and me afloat in the lovely Sabah, my homeland. I don't mind continuing this way, but I have this little nudge in me that, asks me to work in a team.

Recently (or early 2023 if this post got old), an opportunity knocked on my door. It is a mobile app rewrite project that requires multiple me, working full time. At the same time, I still have an ongoing project, which I am committed to see it through. Workload overflows, and funding overflows. Time to grow!

I am now expanding my team of one, and forming a software house by the name Else Studio.

I have nothing much to show as a track record. Here's what I did in terms of web and mobile applications, from the most recent:

1.  [SpeedHome](https://apps.apple.com/my/app/speedhome-my-property-rental/id998232868): Frontned only. Flutter, Andoird and iOS. Teamwork with Else Studio.
2.  [Noehmer](https://app.cn.at): Frontned only. Flutter Web with itbh-console. It has three parts: public for ordering new broadband service, customer self-service and sales for internal use.
3.  [CariTenant](https://caritenant.my): SvelteKit.
4.  itbh Console (private): A Dart programming language framework that generates Flutter projects with routing, Stream-powered services and components.
5.  [B4 the date](https://b4the.date) : Svelte + PouchDB/CoucbDB + Cloudflare workers and pages.
6.  [TaraKita](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/tarakita-app) : Svelte + PouchDB + Cloudflare.
7.  [fp-svelte](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/fp-tailwindcss-svelte-template): Svelte starter template with a functional programming twist. Used by the two projects above.
8.  ANA (private): Offline first web application to support heavy industry asset management in the field. AngularDart + PouchDB/CouchDB.
9.  [dorker](https://github.com/yuan-kuan/dorker) : Web worker for AngularDart.

Before I built these web applications as a solo freelancer, I was a game developer. Worked in Unity and Ubisoft Singapore.
