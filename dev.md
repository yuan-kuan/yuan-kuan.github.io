# You're a web/app/frontend/backend/any developer? Come work with Else Studio.

## Why?

**Freedom.**

You will start with a **project-based or task-based payment**. As soon as the work is done and the goal is met, we conclude the project, and you get the pay by the month's end, accumulated, and then we proceed to the next project. Just keep me posted with progress every work day, even if it is a small step. Maybe we will do a one-hour face-to-face meeting for the project conclusion. Maybe we will do a one-hour pair programming every other week. Maybe.

And that is it.

I do not know when you start working, how long is your break, or if you bring the kids to the beach on Monday morning. You could be hard at work, covered in noise-cancelling earphones in the middle of a noisy caf√©, on a Sunday afternoon. Or shopping in an empty mall after an 11 a.m. brunch on a Tuesday. A night owl, peak at 3 a.m.? You do you. [This is how I work.](https://world.hey.com/kuan/my-typical-working-day-110e376b)

Deliver, on time and on point. We will build a reputable dev team together.

## How much?

Ultimately, most of the pay is calculated on an hourly basis. For the current opening, you can expect a roughy **RM 50/hour** payout, depending on your speed and accuracy. As mentioned, the first few payouts will be project-based. I will estimate the hours required for the task to price each project. The heuristic I used in my estimation was how many hours I assumed myself to complete the same project/task, and then I multiplied by my hourly rate. So, in essence, you will be paid for the hours you took off from me.

Completing these projects will let us learn about our chemistry, shortcomings, progress speed and the adjusted hourly rate for you.

## What is the work?

We are a software house specialising in **frontend development**, slowly moving into **full-stack**. **Flutter** is the primary tool of choice, to build mobile applications, web applications, and potentially desktop applications. We have not fully worked on a **full-stack** project yet, but we are slowly taking up **Java** backend job. **ReactJS** is used in maintaining a few clients' ongoing web applications. 

Here are a few recently completed tasks, that fall under the scope of this job:

- Understand the client's requirements posted in our Basecamp project. Ask questions to flush out the details. Implement the feature step by step. From scratch to complete.
- Follow the flow of the app states, listen to the changes and send out Firebase analytics events based on different conditions.
- Without relying on third-party packages, create a custom Widget. e.g. phone number input with country flag, Unique collage of photos, animated carousel indicator, OTP fields, etc.
- Follow the instructions of the client's designer, perform fine-grain GUI polish and perform Flutter magic to match the Figma mock-up. Don't worry, not pixel-perfect.
- Refactor the codes to become more readable, and create sharable Widgets/Functions after a handful of duplications of codes.
- Look at the bug report, navigate the codes and fix the bug.

We will practice most of Effective Dart. Strictly follow the discipline of logic vs presentation. Stateless first, stateful later. Asynchronous is our way of life. Always keep our Widget and integration tests populous and up to date. Test, test and test.

UX and UI designs are adequately provided by our clients, but we need to be sensitive to the result of our implementation. To the best of our ability, and within the boundary given by the original design, we will deliver a GUI that makes sense and looks good. There will be a gap between the expectation of the intended design and the reality of UI programming and Flutter. It is our job to provide suggestions and advice back to the client for adaptation.

My current clients are either very good backend developer or already has a stable running backend. You will not write backend code here, at the moment. The future is unpredictable, and nothing is stopping you from doing anything on your own time.

## Who is in it together?

If you end up joining, the team size will be 5.

A handful of software engineers with one or two QAs should make a beefy team for a good-sized application. As soon as we manage to sign a bigger project that includes UX&UI scope, I will invite a dedicated UX UI designer to the team.

Except for the rare occasion that you might interact with the client's backend programmer or designer, you will be working with less than 5 people, for a long while.

## When can you start?

**Anytime**.

## How to apply?

Prepare an **email**. In it:

1.  Tell me who you are.
2.  Tell me about one of the software you built during your early programming days, no matter how small or insignificant.
3.  Do you like any of these? Why and why not?
4.  A link to your GitHub or GitLab or any public (or private) repositories that contain your projects and/or contributions.

**Number 4 is crucial**. **Git and the ability to build an app** are our requirements to work here. If you need time to push or create a project, you can ping me with an email first and send me the links when you're done. Exposing your projects is a good thing to do, even if you end up not wanting this job.

Send it to [kuan@hey.com](mailto:kuan@hey.com). I will get back to you very quickly. Please expect a couple of email exchanges before we start the first project.
